The Bamazon app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.


How to Start:

    1. Clone the repo. 
    2. Run command npm install in GitBash or Terminal. 
    3. Run command node bamazonCustomer.js


Running bamazonCustomer.js will display all of the items available for sale followed
by a question 'Enter the ID of the product you want to buy' 

![]()


User enters the product ID# and hits enter 

![]()

A second question asks the user 'How many units do you want to buy?' 

![]()

User enters the number of units they would like to purchase. If it's more than what's in stock, the user will be notified 'Insufficient Quantity! and then the prompts reset.

![]()

Issues: 
    Can't get the function to complete the purchase, update the SQL database to reflect the remaining qty, and display the total cost of their purchase.
